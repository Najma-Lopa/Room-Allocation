### **2. Overall Description**

This section provides a high-level perspective of the "HSTU\_T\&S\_HUB" application. It describes the product's context, its core functions, its user base, its operating environment, and the constraints and assumptions that will govern its development.

#### **2.1 Product Perspective**

The "HSTU\_T\&S\_HUB" system is a new, self-contained, mobile-first application developed to serve the specific academic needs of the HSTU community. It is not an extension of an existing product family or a replacement for a legacy system but rather a novel solution designed to address gaps in current academic communication methods.[12]

The application is architected as a client-server system. The client-side application is a cross-platform mobile app developed using the Flutter framework. The server-side functionality is entirely managed through Google's Firebase platform, which acts as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS). This serverless architecture choice is fundamental, as it allows the development to focus on the user-facing application logic while leveraging Google's robust, scalable, and real-time infrastructure for data management, authentication, and other backend services.[6, 13]

A high-level system context diagram visually illustrates the system's boundaries and its primary interactions with external actors and services. The diagram shows the mobile application as the central component, interacting with three user classes (Teacher, Student, CR) and relying on various Firebase services for its operation.

#### **2.2 Product Functions**

The following is a high-level summary of the major functions the "HSTU\_T\&S\_HUB" application will perform. Detailed specifications for each function are provided in Section 3.2 of this document.[14]

  * **User Role Management:** Secure login and registration for Teachers and Students.
  * **Dynamic User Interfaces:** The application interface dynamically changes to provide role-specific features, particularly for Class Representatives (CRs).
  * **Online Quiz Management:** Teachers can create, manage, and grade online quizzes. Students can participate in these quizzes in real-time.
  * **Real-Time Resource Sharing:** Teachers can instantly share learning materials (documents, notes, PDFs) with students.
  * **AI-Powered Assistance:** An integrated chatbot provides automated answers to common academic queries.
  * **Multi-Channel Communication:** The system supports various communication channels, including class-wide discussions and exclusive, direct communication between teachers and CRs.
  * **Class Management:** Teachers can view student lists and designate a CR for each course.
  * **Academic Information Hub:** Users can view comprehensive details about their courses, schedules, and room allocations.
  * **Smart Alarm System:** A utility feature that allows users to set automated alarms for their upcoming classes.
  * **Performance Tracking:** Students can view their quiz scores and receive performance feedback from teachers.

#### **2.3 User Classes and Characteristics**

The system is designed to be used by three distinct classes of users, each with different characteristics, goals, and system privileges. The differentiation of these user classes is essential for implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and tailoring the user experience to meet specific needs.[12, 15]

**Table 2: User Classes and Characteristics**

| User Class | Characteristics | Privileges / Permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

#### **2.4 Operating Environment**

The software is designed to operate in the following environments [12]:

  * **Client-Side (Mobile Application):**
      * **Operating Systems:** The application must be fully functional on:
          * Android 8.0 (Oreo, API level 26) and newer.
          * iOS 13.0 and newer.
      * **Hardware:** The application is intended for smartphones and tablets and requires a minimum of:
          * 2 GB of RAM.
          * 100 MB of available local storage for the application and cached data.
          * A stable internet connection (Wi-Fi, 4G, or 5G) for real-time features.
  * **Server-Side (Backend):**
      * The application's backend is built entirely on the Google Firebase platform. As a BaaS, the server hardware, operating system, and infrastructure maintenance are managed by Google Cloud. The application's performance and availability are therefore dependent on the operational status of these services.

#### **2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints**

The development of "HSTU\_T\&S\_HUB" is bound by the following constraints, which are non-negotiable technical decisions that shape the architecture and implementation of the system [5, 16]:

  * **Frontend Framework:** The client application **must** be developed using the **Flutter** framework to ensure a single codebase for both Android and iOS platforms.
  * **Backend Platform:** The application **must** utilize **Google Firebase** as its exclusive Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS). All backend functionalities—including but not limited to user authentication, database management, file storage, and push notifications—will be implemented using the corresponding Firebase services.[7, 13]
  * **Programming Language:** The primary programming language for the client application **must** be **Dart**.
  * **Development Methodology:** The project development **must** adhere to an **Incremental SDLC Model**, where the system is built and delivered in functional parts.
  * **Database Type:** The application will use a NoSQL database provided by Firebase (either Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore), chosen based on the specific needs of different features for querying complexity and data structure.[11]

#### **2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies**

The design and operation of the system are based on the following assumptions and dependencies [17]:

  * **Assumptions:**
      * **User Identity:** It is assumed that all users (Teachers and Students) will possess a unique and verifiable HSTU-issued identifier (e.g., a student or faculty ID number) that can be used for the registration and authentication process.
      * **Network Connectivity:** It is assumed that users will have access to a reasonably consistent and reliable internet connection. While Firebase's offline persistence will handle temporary disruptions, the core real-time functionalities of the application are fundamentally dependent on network access.[11]
      * **AI Chatbot Content:** It is assumed that the knowledge base for the AI Chatbot will be pre-populated with a curated set of frequently asked questions and answers relevant to HSTU's academic policies, schedules, and procedures.
  * **Dependencies:**
      * **Firebase Platform:** The application is critically dependent on the availability, reliability, and API consistency of Google Firebase services. Any outage, deprecation of features, or changes in Firebase's terms of service could directly and significantly impact the application's functionality.
      * **Third-Party App Stores:** The distribution and updating of the mobile application are dependent on the policies and approval processes of the Google Play Store (for Android) and the Apple App Store (for iOS).

### **4. Conclusion**

This Software Requirements Specification document provides a comprehensive and detailed foundation for the development of the "HSTU\_T\&S\_HUB" mobile application, Version 1.0. It formally captures the product's scope, delineates its intended user base, and establishes the architectural constraints, chief among them being the use of Flutter for the client and Google Firebase for the backend.

The document meticulously outlines all specific requirements, breaking them down into functional capabilities that define *what* the system will do, and non-functional attributes that define *how well* it will do it. By providing specific, measurable, and testable requirements for performance, security, usability, and reliability, this SRS serves as a critical tool for quality assurance.

As the project follows an incremental development model, this document represents the definitive blueprint for the initial development cycles. It will act as a living document, subject to controlled revisions and updates, providing a stable and traceable baseline against which all future work can be planned, executed, and verified. Adherence to this specification will ensure that the final product aligns with the project's goals of creating a streamlined, efficient, and engaging academic communication system for the HSTU community.
